### Hello There

Hi, my name is Raphael.  
I'm a German developer who loves to code stuff for Garry's Mod, loves to optimize everything, encrypt stuff like VCMod, and loves to document stuff in the Gmod wiki. 
Currently, I made around 1817 changes in the Gmod wiki. (Last Updated: 6/25/2023)  
If you have an interesting idea for Gmod or you want something/need help with something, feel free to write me on discord(raphaelit7).  
You can also make an issue on any of my repos if you have any request, issue or question.
